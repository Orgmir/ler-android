New daily notification when you have new unread posts. You can choose which subscriptions to get updates from.

Also in this release:
- Add a settings screen, with options to configure the notification trigger time
- Fixed feed links not getting parsed correctly
- Fixed date parsing, so they take into account users locale (and actually work)
